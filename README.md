>I am studying the relationship between political violence and income inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa because I want to learn more about the outcomes of political violence. I am using Gini coefficient and Political Terror Scale’s 1-5 rating as my variables. My visualization is based on Wider’s World Income Inequality Database, Political Terror Scale’s database, and Center for Systemic Peace’s PITF State Failure Problem Set.

## Data Review

–––

###“According to Freedom House, there were only four full electoral democracies in Africa in 1990, which increased to 20 countries by this year.” 
p. 25 Growth, Poverty and Inequality Interactions in Africa: An Overview of Key Issues

###With political upheaval comes political violence and trauma. Comparing this political violence to changes in Gini could reveal interesting stories about the economic byproducts of violence and revolution.

Political Terror Scale records countries’ compliance with international human rights standards by gathering data from Amnesty International, the US State Dept, and Human Rights watch, and employing a five level coding scheme based on the 1980 Freedom House Yearbook.

###Primary Source 2:

World Income Inequality Database’s by country / year / Gini data will allow the relationship to be visualized in depth over time.

###Questions:
1. The WIID3.3 database has several instances where multiple entries for a single year where there are multiple entries for a single year. (See example below) Some of these have clear differentiators but others less so. Should these be averaged?

2. To have a more robust dataset, I would like to combine the Gini scores from the Poverty & Equity database with the WIID3.3. However, the World Bank data set does not offer the level of detail on survey type that the WIID3 does. Can the datasets be combined?
