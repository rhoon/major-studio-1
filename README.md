## Quantitative Data

###1.

###The impact on Gini by in/out flow of large sums of money into Africa is difficult to judge. While capital flights were examined to a degree, the relationship between the large inflow of aid (Primary Source 1) and Gini (Primary Source 2) could also be reveal interesting trends.

###Primary Source 1:
http://aiddata.org/country-level-research-datasets

AidData’s data set details aid promised and received by/for donors & recipient countries, the reason for the aid (in broad terms) and year of donation.

AidData was founded in 2009, is backed by the College of William & Mary, Development Gateway and Brigham Young University.

###Primary Source 2:
https://www.wider.unu.edu/download/WIID3.3

World Income Inequality Database’s by country / year / Gini data will allow the relationship to be visualized in depth over time.

###Questions:
1. Because aid is sometimes related to crisis, the effectiveness of aid in countries experiencing crises may be dramatically different than non-crisis aid. Should the comparison limit aid data to that not associated with crises?

2. Expanding on the previous question, is there a specific category of aid that would be most helpful to see in comparison to the Gini?

###“According to Freedom House, there were only four full electoral democracies in Africa in 1990, which increased to 20 countries by this year.”

###With political upheaval comes political violence and trauma. Comparing this political violence to changes in Gini could reveal interesting stories about the economic byproducts of violence and revolution.

###Questions:
1. Do difficulties in gathering income data during times of violence cloud Gini in ways that would make this not viable?
