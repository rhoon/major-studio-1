>I am studying the relationship between political violence and revolution events in Africa because I want to learn more about the causes and outcomes of political violence. I am using Political Terror Scale’s 1-5 rating and a timeline of revolution events as my variables. My visualization is based on Political Terror Scale’s database and Center for Systemic Peace’s PITF State Failure Problem Set.

## Data Review

###“According to Freedom House, there were only four full electoral democracies in Africa in 1990, which increased to 20 countries by this year.” 
p. 25 Growth, Poverty and Inequality Interactions in Africa: An Overview of Key Issues

###With political upheaval comes political violence and trauma. Comparing this political violence to changes in Gini could reveal interesting stories about the economic byproducts of violence and revolution.
